# AI-Native Consumer Health Co-Pilot

This project explores what a consumer health experience looks like
when AI itself is the interface.

Instead of listing ingredients or health scores, the system reasons
on the user's behalf and explains trade-offs and uncertainty at the
moment a food decision is made.
